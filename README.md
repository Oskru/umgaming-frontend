# Frontend part of Minecraft Server web app

This project is a React frontend part of the whole app (backend section found in [here](https://github.com/Oskru/umgaming-backend)) showing custom server events and providing an ability to give a player logged in to the server a daily reward. <br><br>
I'm not really into creating MC server plugins, so integrating a well known web app with Minecraft's RCon protocool seemed like a way to go :)

## Live preview

Disclaimer: there can be a significant delay on the first request since the backend service got suspended because of inactivity.

## Tools / libraries used to build

- React
- Vite
- CSS

## Installation and starting the development server

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands: `npm install` and `npm run dev`

This will start the server on `http://localhost:5173` where all functionalities of communicating with backend service should be working flawlessly.
